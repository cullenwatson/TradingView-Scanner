# Roadmap
1. ~~Sign into TradingView and solve the captcha~~
* ~~Save the cookies in case restart of program~~
2. ~~Start websocket connection to TradingView~~
   * fetch the exchange automatically to just input a ticker
3. Load desired chart template
4. Load desired stock symbols and timeframe

5. Receive and parse stock feed and custom indicator data
6. Support concurrent connection feeds to multiple stock symbols


## why not other repos

- they dont auto sign into acc
- they dont give custom indicator values that are only available in your acc (private scripts)
